# This MATLAB-based behavioral rating tool can allow you to play a video 
#     and do the simultaneous rating with a mouse or touchpad.
#
# The temoral resolution of the rating is equal to the frame rate of the video.
#
# It is easy to use: move the curser toward the top or button of the screen
#     in order to rate a higher or lower scale without any clicks.
